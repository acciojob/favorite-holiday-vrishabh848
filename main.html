<h1>
	Saxony’s splendid palaces and castles
</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		With so many palaces and castles to choose from, it is hard to make a selection but Dresden’s Royal Palace close to the Semper Opera, Zwinger and Church of Our Lady is, no doubt, a highlight. The palace is among the city’s oldest buildings and suffered hugely during the bombing of Dresden in 1945. Renovation has been gradual since 1985 and the palace is now back to its former Renaissance and Baroque glory. The magnificent Royal State Apartments of Augustus the Strong, the Small Ballroom and the so-called Long Corridor, an impressive ancestral gallery, are the latest splendid spaces to have reopened in 2019 and 2021 after faithful restoration. Prepare to be wowed!
